This Library Management System in C provides basic functionality for managing a library using file handling. The system allows users to add new books by saving their details to a file, ensuring an updated record of available books. Users can display all the books in the library, search for specific books by title or author, issue books to members by updating their status in the file, and delete books from the system when they are no longer needed. By leveraging file handling in C, this system ensures that all operations are persistent and data integrity is maintained across sessions.
